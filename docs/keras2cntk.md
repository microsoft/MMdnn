# Keras "inception_v3" to CNTK conversion example

Model: ["inception_v3" for ImageNet](https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-models)

Source: Keras 2.1.3

Destination: CNTK 2.4

---

## Framework Installation

Install [Keras](https://keras.io/#installation) and [CNTK](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cognitive-toolkit/Setup-CNTK-on-your-machine) in case

```bash
$ pip install keras

$ pip install https://cntk.ai/PythonWheel/CPU-Only/cntk-2.4-cp27-cp27mu-linux_x86_64.whl
or
$ pip install https://cntk.ai/PythonWheel/CPU-Only/cntk-2.4-cp35-cp35m-linux_x86_64.whl
```

## Keras Model Preparation

You need to prepare your pre-trained keras model firstly. And there is a pre-trained model extractor for frameworks to help you. You can refer it to extract your Keras model structure and weights.

```bash
$ mmdownload -f keras -n inception_v3

Keras model inception_v3 is saved in [./imagenet_inception_v3.h5]
```

The you got the Keras pre-trained inception_v3 model which is downloaded to current working directory.

## Convert Keras Model to CNTK

We provide two ways to convert models.

### **One-step Command**

Above MMdnn@0.1.4, we provide one command to achieve the conversion

```bash
$ mmconvert -sf keras -iw imagenet_inception_v3.h5 -df cntk -om keras_to_cntk_inception_v3.dnn
.
.
.
CNTK model file is saved as [keras_to_cntk_inception_v3.dnn], generated by [2c33f7f278cb46be992f50226fcfdb5d.py] and [2c33f7f278cb46be992f50226fcfdb5d.npy].
```

Then you get the CNTK original model *keras_to_cntk_inception_v3.dnn* converted from Keras. **2c33f7f278cb46be992f50226fcfdb5d.py** and **2c33f7f278cb46be992f50226fcfdb5d.npy** are temporal files which will be removed automatically.

### **Step-by-step Command (for debugging)**

#### Convert the pre-trained model files to intermediate representation

```bash
$ mmtoir -f keras -w imagenet_inception_v3.h5 -o converted

Using TensorFlow backend.
.
.
.
IR network structure is saved as [converted.json].
IR network structure is saved as [converted.pb].
IR weights are saved as [converted.npy].
```

Then you got the **intermediate representation** files *converted.json* for visualization, *converted.pb* and *converted.npy* for next steps.

#### Convert the IR files to CNTK models

```bash
$ mmtocode -f cntk -d converted_cntk.py -n converted.pb -w converted.npy

Parse file [converted.pb] with binary format successfully.
Target network code snippet is saved as [converted_cntk.py].
```

And you will get a filename *converted_cntk.py*, which contains the **original CNTK** codes to build the *Inception V3* network.

With the three steps, you have already converted the pre-trained Keras Inception_v3 models to CNTK network file *converted_cntk.py* and weight file *converted.npy*. You can use these two files to fine-tune training or inference.

#### Dump the original CNTK model

```bash
$ mmtomodel -f cntk -in converted_cntk -iw converted.npy -o cntk_inception_v3.dnn
.
.
.
CNTK model file is saved as [cntk_inception_v3.dnn], generated by [converted_cntk.py] and [converted.npy].
```
The file *cntk_inception_v3.dnn* can be loaded by CNTK directly.
